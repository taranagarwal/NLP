oh  
uh_huh  
oh  
why don't you start  
things you already owned or things that you've picked up just to do that  
are they things you already owned or you pick them up just to do that [refinishing]  
yeah  
i've done both  
uh uh my wife has picked up a couple of things saying uh boy if we could [refinish] that that would be a beautiful piece of furniture  
and uh we've done it a couple of times  
i guess that   we've been fairly successful with those  
that's uh that's a kind of low risk sort of project isn't it i guess  
uh i have a a uh really nice desk a nicer desk than i could afford which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital uh   [liberated] it after a fire  
and uh we stripped it all the way down and [refinished] it  
and it turned out to be really nice uh a nice desk   maple top i think or or   something of that sort  
oh really  
oh i'm jealous  
uh_huh  
yeah  
i i do do things uh that might be too [crude] to be called woodworking  
i've built my own deck and uh   things like that  
and uh   i definitely have begun to accumulate tools too  
my i uh   i picked up a bunch of [craftsman] tools from the forties that my wife's father owned when he was alive  
and so i do have a band saw and a router and uh things like that out in the garage  
but i can't say i use them very often  
they're handy uh they   they come in handy at the most unusual times  
putting doors in is the time when i'm  
uh i bought myself a uh [template] for making [mortices] and doors  
and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a [chisel]  
but i've also i've also used them for building drawers where you uh for [rabbeting] and uh because uh [rabbeting] on my table on my uh radial arm saw is a little bit [uncertain]  
so i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it  
and now i use it twice a year maybe  
the big  
uh i guess it  
the ones that what  
uh i have never even i have never even looked at one closely  
uh the the   little use that i've gotten from my router i would say uh i would spend my money on the bits  
uh i have a i'd guess you'd call a medium quality [craftsman] router  
and the uh  
it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say three eighths of an inch at a time  
but the problem is that the uh as with  
any any time you buy a a   tool with   a a as a as a package   the bits that they give you are low end  
so the price of a good set of uh [carbide] steel uh bits is probably uh i mean a a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars  
and uh uh if you're going to use for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it  
because uh  
i imagine if i go and [sharpen] them myself uh they won't last  
and i've never had the bits [sharpened]  
so   that's a thing to consider is to  
yeah  
and they they dull after awhile  
especially i did some cabinets in uh ash and oak  
and uh that that wears a bit down  
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets uh   which had been in the original   remodeling of our kitchen  
and i saved them and built an oven cabinet out of one and another cabinet out of another by using the faces and so forth  
and uh   [routing] hardwood will uh take the edge off a cheap bit pretty fast  
so  
right  
that's uh  
and then you take the blade to the   to get [sharpened] right  
uh_huh  
right  
yeah  
well i've used mine on treated wood  
and now all my blades need [sharpening]   because uh treated wood will also chew them up  
oh i don't know  
i uh i [refinished] a couple of old uh [dressers] that were handed down  
you know nice it's nice tongue and [groove] uh uh construction  
uh that's been i've been pretty successful with that  
what  
no  
i've done some other things too uh you know  
yeah  
oh yeah  
yeah  
that's a good way to get started  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
yeah  
i i uh put together a a up [rolltop] desk from scratch  
you know a kit  
yeah  
still had to cut it and everything  
but   it was fun  
uh_huh  
yeah  
i i've done the same you know like the trim around the house you know   the [baseboards] and things like that  
uh_huh  
um yeah  
i'm looking at trying to get a router right now  
i'll bet  
uh_huh  
yeah  
my my brother's used it a lot for making drawers  
i don't   know  
what what's your opinion of what a good router is like  
you know i  
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great  
they've plastic parts and stuff  
that you dial in on the side  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
how strong is it  
don't they  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
they they really get hot don't they  
uh_huh  
uh_huh  
right  
yeah  
i've cut some one by eight oak before  
boy was that fun  
big solid pieces of oak are just   tough  
well that was you know with a with a circular saw  
like oh my gosh  
is this going to be fun  
yeah  
treated wood can really make you sick too  
i guess we get started now
i don't know
i you know i've always was interested in in woodworking
i watch a lot of the p b s stations where they have uh you know the woodworking
uh shows and that
but i've never really done anything myself because i don't really have the tools for it
but uh someday when i can get up uh enough of the tools i i want to try and make a lot of the stuff i got books on it and everything that shows you step by step on how to do it
but uh
oh well i think anything from you know building a house uh to [cabinetry] would be woodworking
i mean i i think that would be classified that you built a tree house pretty good
yeah
yeah
uh_huh
yeah
i think so
you get skills in that uh that helps you in almost anything you do
so
yeah
that's fine
yeah
i wanted a maybe i might try and uh even though i don't have too much tools
but i don't think it takes too much to build a book shelf i know i i need one
so maybe
yeah
well it sounds like both our dads are good
my dad made a a whole wall cabinet uh closet type thing
and all he did was he hired someone once to build it
and then he watched them
and he uh built it himself
and he did
yeah
it's kind of a a a closet cabinet uh built on a whole wall
took up the whole wall
and it's got uh the for hanging up shirts and pants area and drawers and all sorts of things in there
it's pretty yeah
pretty fancy yeah
yeah
i know uh
i know watching these programs with some of the fancy tools they have that it makes it so easy that i think almost anyone could do it if they could afford the probably four or five thousand dollars for each item they got
uh it just about everything
it does uh you know different things for for different cuts and that and uh i think it would make it so much easier
but i think that would be more for the professional if you're going to do it as a business those types of tools are fine
yeah
yeah
