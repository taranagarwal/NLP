hello
hey what happened
what do they do when you're done
do they just [disconnect] you
well i just got disconnected i think his he's got a kid there
it's clinton right
clint okay
is it clint right
um i'm pretty serious it's a serious hobby
i guess
um i'd like more
but yeah
i'm getting up there
i just have a used table saw right now i'm looking at getting a better one
but it's just an old sears [craftsman] uh mostly fine woodworking furniture type stuff
um enjoy the children's toys i like making those
so it's basically smaller stuff
have you done much big stuff
right
you do kitchen cabinets and stuff
uh_huh
finish finish carpentry or
uh_huh
no
yeah
i got a i just finished a project one of those um [swinging] [cradles] and i turned all the [spindles] for that
and that took a long time
but it was pretty fun
yeah
oak that's really hard to turn
but
yeah
had to fill a lot of chip marks up
but it really chips really easy
do you work with oak much
not at all
uh_huh
yeah
that's
i tried it for a job once
and it's just not for me i like it as a hobby more
boy
it sure is
i just enjoy making gifts and doing small stuff on the side
yeah
yeah
once in a while i'll sell some um custom custom type wood work if they're willing to pay the price now i used to get ripped off all the time because i spent way too much time on them
um i'm starting to i that's what i did for a job one summer
i made some cabinets for a junior high school and but i haven't done a lot of them
i use oak face frames
and then just plywood for the box
yeah
but just on the outside where it shows
yeah
just slip it into a [groove] that you make on the face frame
and then you can just slip that in there
it's a lot cheaper
of course quarter inch and three quarter inch aren't much cheaper than each other of plywood but
yeah
just
for to the plywood yeah
i just finish sand
it just like with one fifty
and then you can finish it up
so
um
just the garage
i wish i had a [workshop]
but the stuff i do
i i don't need a lot of room for it
uh she puts up with me buying the tools
she likes me wood working
but getting the equipment i want sure is taken a lot of years i started when i was about sixteen
buying my own equipment and i only need a few more things like a [joiner] i'd like to have and small some smaller things
oh yeah
yeah
i just bought a a [sprayer] to finish my project um a high volume low pressure [sprayer] it's a high volume low pressure they're new [sprayers] that are coming out
really
little over spray it's air it only sprays with three p s i
but uh the [cubic] feet per minute of air flow is up to ninety
and so that's what that's what gives you your [thrust] of your paint
um do you do
it was five hundred bucks
my most recent woodworking project was i made an oak trash can
it's the new thing around here is people want trash cans which match their kitchen cabinets
so and i'm if the definition of a professional means you get paid for it
then i am one
yeah
i really am in the [telecommunications] business
but you know one has to do what you can do to make a buck
i got uh well your basic stuff your radial arm your table your drill press
what
i don't do is i don't i don't turn
yeah
you know
you know i build boxes as people say
uh_huh
oh yeah
i am i don't get either one i look through them at the uh at the [newsstand] and buy them on occasion
i get a a newspaper called the [workshop] news and i get a uh um let's see i can't read the side of it
uh [woodsmith] i think it's called
it's a you know a monthly sort of brown paper type of type of thing
oh yeah
oh i've looked through both of them you can just only afford to subscribe to so many there's an
