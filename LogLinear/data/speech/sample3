uh_huh
uh yes
now there you can get upside down and backwards doing crown molding
you know as soon as you get your head upside down and backwards you're fine
i made an [armoire] recently for my wife's store
and the top of it has [curved] crown molding that will yeah
uh_huh
it sure did
it wasn't what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it
how did you [miter] the corners uh_huh
no
i don't build it if somebody is not buying it
i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock english garden bench which i make
which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear
on the east coast
is i make it up out of your regularly old forty c p i pressure treated lumber and then paint it
which saves on the cost
yeah [teak] is awfully expensive
but the thing about [teak] is you can't set it on the ground you have to set it like on [flagstone] or concrete or something
yeah
it's just not made for direct ground contact it pulls the it pulls the oil right out of it
it it's all right outside if you go out every year
and you know oil it
but you know the the old green pressure treated you can ignore it
if the paint falls off it's still not going to hurt the wood
you know the [paint's] only just to cover up the fact it's green
uh_huh
uh_huh
yeah
i don't do a whole lot of that i've done some i one nice thing about living in this area is the [smithsonian] is nearby
and they have you can call them their [restoration] lab
and they're happy to talk to you
so you might file that if you don't mind paying the long distance charges
their [restoration] labs will be very are very happy to talk to you and say you know
and you say hey i've got on what do i do now
woodworking do you do much in the way of woodworking
i'm in about the same condition uh had access to a fair amount at my father's place before i moved away
but uh
that's been several years ago
but i've always always enjoyed what chances
i had to do woodworking
framing like picture framing
oh okay
yeah
okay
yeah
right
now what i've got in the way of woodworking tools is a circular saw and a uh square
that's it
well a drill i do have a drill yeah
i don't know the woodworking projects i've been involved with lately
we uh converted a uh a very large section of [shelving] from one restaurant that went belly up
into a small smaller set for the home
needed something for my textbooks and my computer to stand on
um you know
ooh
uh_huh
they smooth faced doors
these are like smooth faced doors
yeah
it would a good table top
oh the fellow with a beard that's hooked up with sears now
[villa] or somebody
[dohinkey] new yankee [workshop]
oh okay
series though
huh
yeah
oh yeah
he's got he's got the sort of thing that that uh you know professional shop would envy more than likely
if i had yeah
yeah
well actually a lot of that stuff you can still do
but it just takes more time
and a lot more talent when you got you got limited resources yeah
oh yeah
it's expensive stuff
and last piece
of hardwood that i bought was uh let's see a a one by ten by one one inch by ten inch by four foot
piece of uh of walnut oh beautiful piece of walnut and now for the life of me
i don't remember what i did with that board i carried it around
i got it all [sanded] out and [planed] out and never did get done with whatever it was i'd originally planned to do with it
i think i wound up giving it to my little brother
yeah
anyway
uh_huh
yeah
yeah
yeah
it's one night a week
and i think it's something you'd probably really enjoy
i don't know
i was i thirty three on and just started college
and i mean going into it like oh it sounds you know like it'd be fun
but and i had all kinds of little [buts] that never really [amounted] to much
but you know when i finally got into it
i was so glad i did
yeah
yeah
it it's it's
