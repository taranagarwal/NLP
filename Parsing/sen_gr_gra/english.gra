# This is a fragment of English grammar, somewhat imperfect in its
# description.  To understand the file format, first look through
# arith.gra, arith-infix.gra, and arith-typed.gra.  
#
# The grammar assumes that the input has been passed through some
# modest morphological preprocessing.  See the sample inputs in
# english.sen.
# 
# Some important omissions that you will not fix in this assignment:
# 
# - Slashed categories like S/NP, and their uses such as relative
#   clauses and questions.  The syntax and semantics of slashed
#   categories could indeed be handled in this framework, although it
#   is more elegant if one builds some special support into the formalism.
# 
# - Extra orders for quantifiers (e.g., the joke semantics for "A
#   woman has a baby every 15 minutes").  There is no attempt to
#   handle this.  It is actually tied up with the previous point.
#
# - The semantics for tense is not as sophisticated as what we did
#   in class.  Here I just write Past(love(Jill,Joe)) instead of
#     E%e past(e) ^ act(e,loving) ^ lover(e,Joe) ^ lovee(e,Jill)
#   This could be fixed (especially with some slashed category support),
#   but the semantics was already hard enough to read!  
#
# - There is no attempt to figure out what pronouns refer to.
#
# - Lots of interesting grammatical constructions are missing, like
#   passives.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# This most basic rule of English combines a subject with a tensed VP
# (never a stem or infinitive VP).  The operators pres and past get
# wrapped around the semantics only here (see discussion of verb
# suffixes below).

1 S[=2 sem=2(1)]	NP[num=N] VP[num=N tense=modal]  # already has semantics


# A speech act is a top level sentence (plus some punctuation).
# In the semantics here, the constant "speaker" is bound to whoever is speaking ("I"),
# and the constant "hearer" is bound to whomever they are speaking to ("you").
# One could also use special constants like "now" to refer to
# the time of the speech act.

# A verb phrase in English is made by combining a verb with some
# following material.  The kind of material that the verb wants is
# indicated by its arg attribute.  For example, arg=np means that the
# verb wants an NP, traditionally called a direct object.  
# 
# (Note: There is an obvious similarity to slashed categories here
# since the V is a VP (or S) with missing material.  "Categorial
# grammar" is an approach that combines the two ideas: it writes
# VP[arg=np] as VP/NP, and in general makes heavy use of slashed
# categories.)

1 VP[=1]		      V[arg=none]    # intransitive verbs: "sleep"

# Compound tenses that are constructed by sticking an auxiliary verb
# before an existing VP to change the VP's tense.  This is the natural
# treatment we covered in the syntactic attributes lecture.  (However,
# it does overgenerate a bit: it allows not only "has been eating" but
# also "is having eaten," which does not occur in my dialect of
# English, not to mention "have had had eaten.")

# Basic tenses marked by suffixes on the verb (for 3rd person only).
# Note that we assume some simple morphological preprocessing that
# splits the stem from the suffix in an input verb, both for regular
# and irregular verbs.  Thus the input is assumed to be "the president
# eat -ed the pickle" rather than "the president ate the pickle."
# 
# The tense attribute from the suffix will be carried along as the
# verbs combine with other material to make full verb phrases and
# eventually sentences.  The attribute ends up affecting the semantics
# only at the end of that process -- specifically, in the S NP VP rule.
#
# Note: It would be nicer to treat these cases like the compound tenses.  
# We could have done so if the morphology produced "the president -ed eat 
# the pickle," with the suffix coming BEFORE the verb.  Then -ed could be
# regarded as a kind of auxiliary verb (which applies only after the
# verb has gotten everything but the subject):

# For the auxiliary verbs "have" and "be," we'll also put all the
# (3rd-person) inflected forms directly into the grammar, so that the
# poor user doesn't have to simulate a morphology program and type 
# "have -0 be -ed eat -ing" for "have been eating" but can get away 
# with "have been eat -ing" instead.  
# 
# Note that when these are used as auxiliary verbs, their head, sem,
# and arg attributes are simply ignored.
