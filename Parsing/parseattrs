# Usage: parseattrs foo.gra foo.sen
# where foo.gra is a grammar file and foo.sen is a file of sentences
#
# Creates temporary files foo.gr and foo.par.  These are not deleted,
# in case you want to look at them.

GRAMMAR=${1%.gra}                        # base name without .gra suffix
SENTS=${2%.sen}                          # base name without .sen suffix
./delattrs $1 > $GRAMMAR.gr &&           # produce an attributeless version of the grammar
./checkvocab $GRAMMAR.gr $2 &&           # warn user and stop if input has out-of-vocab words
./parse.py $GRAMMAR.gr $2 > $SENTS.par &&  # parse sentences using this attributeless grammar
./buildattrs $1 $SENTS.par               # attach attributes to the parses
